This movie is Amazing!!! The imagery and colors are remarkable. It brought back so many memories from when I was Young. Let's face it, nothing will ever top the Original. People are complaining about the animals not having emotion line the original?? Are you serious? They try making this movie as real as it gets, you guys want to see a Lion smiling?? Seriously!!! Music was nostalgic, everything was perfect. Best Disney "live-action" movie of all.
